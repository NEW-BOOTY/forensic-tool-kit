## Overview

This enterprise-grade Bash script automates the creation of five production-ready forensic toolkits designed for modern digital investigations. Each toolkit represents a cutting-edge forensic capability addressing emerging threats in AI-driven attacks, quantum computing risks, multi-cloud environments, bio-digital evidence fusion, and adversarial AI forensics.

The script generates complete Maven-based Java projects with:
- Full directory structure (src, config, docs, tests)
- Tool-specific dependencies and configurations
- Production-ready Spring Boot/Micronaut applications
- Security-first architecture with cryptographic best practices
- Comprehensive documentation and deployment guidance
